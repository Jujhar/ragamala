We believe that Lord Shiva created the 5 main Raags: 
```
```
 “Shri” representing Earth, “Megh” representing Water, “Deepak” representing Fire, “Hindol” representing Air and “Bhairav” representing the Sky. We also believe that Goddess Parvati then created the sixth Raag “Malkauns”.

In R@ɡ@ (ਰਾਗ, accompanying nourishment) theory, day and night both consist of <em>4</em> pahars or timings (<em>1,2,3,4 and R1,R2,R3,R4</em>) 

a special quarter for when the sun changes at sunrise or sunset (<em>1</em>), 

morning pahar ∨ first quarter (<em>2</em>), 

mid day (<em>3</em>), 

descending quarter pahar (<em>4</em>). 

So "R@ɡ@ Gorakh Kalyan" is Rat 1 (R1) meaning <em>first quarter of the night</em> and "R@ɡ@ Maajh" (4) is to be listened at <em>the fourth quarter of the day</em>.
